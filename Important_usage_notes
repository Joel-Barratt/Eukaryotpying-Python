The name of the haplotypes/markers in the haplotype data sheet is important. They need to start with "Mt_" or "Nu_". This begining will automatically tell the code what the ploidy setting should be.
If the marker name starts with the prefic "Mt_" the ploidy for that marker will automatically be set to "1". For markerss starting with "Nu_", the ploidy will automatically be set to "2".
